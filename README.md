Vital registration data management system
=========================================

Computerised civil registration data management system, which can be accessed and used by concerned departments
at various levels from ward/village tract to central level. The system will be placed within the CSO,
initially at district level, with the longer term aim of connecting to townships and further down to wards
and village tracts. This system can be used for planning purposes, statistics
and as a database of individual records of each child.

Supported forms:
* F101 - birth registration
* F201 - death registration
* F103 - birth certificate
* F203 - death certificate
